<h1>The Best Christmas Movies According to Niki</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Christmas movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Klaus</h3>
<p>Heartwarming and silly. Love the animation style and how the mysteries of Santa Claus's magic are explained.</p>
<h3>The Holiday</h3>
<p>A story of perseverance and taking back control from those who mistreat us to find contentment and happiness with ourselves and those who appreciate us.</p>
<h3>Mickey's Christmas Carol</h3>
<p>Nostalgia definitely dictates this choice.  It reminds me of the Christmases of my childhood in all the best ways and has always been my favorite version of the classic tale.</p>
